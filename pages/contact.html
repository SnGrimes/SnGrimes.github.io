    <p><span>A little about me...</span>I initially went to college seeking an animation degree. I've always been proficient with web code and have created a few HTML/CSS website since 2004. After graduating and finding that the movie and videogame animation fields no longer appeals to me, I have decided to put all of my energy into learning as much about web development as possible. Basically, I like the internet so I figure: <span>Why not contribute to it?</span> </p>

    <p>I am a problem solver. I'm always looking for a faster and more efficient way of doing anything and everything. I bring this mindset into my development projects. I will keep looking at a problem from all different angles. The more I can learn about the quirks of CSS and the quirks of each browser the better.</p>
    
    <p>My strengths lie in coding itself, mostly front end code. I can easily take a mock-up design and recreate it in HTML/CSS. I recently discovered a javascript based animation library called Greensock. I plan to continue learning about this form of animation since I have always loved the art of animation.</p>
